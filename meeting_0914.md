# meeting 09/14
**Advisor: Dr. Chih-Yu Wang**
**Presenter: Shao-Heng Chen**
**Date: September 14, 2022**
- Original goals
  - find some ways to **simulate** ADC raw data
  - find some other ways, besides plotting RD maps, to **process** ADC raw data
  - among these possible methods, find one that best preserve class features
- Radar Signature
  - there are 5 kinds of radar signatures we may be able to use
    - PointCloud
    - RCS
    - Phase
    - Motion
    - Polarimetric
  - most papers are based on **real radar measurements**

  - in this paper, the **PO method** is used since most common traffic targets do not often present any sharp edges and are for the most parts convex
